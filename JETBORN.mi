Name=JETBORN
Description="\"Too Fast for Squad\" is no longer a meme. JETBORN breaks the ground rules of Squad—literally. This experimental mod introduces “Squad-capable” Fighter jets, allowing players to drop into the battlefield from the sky at high speed like never before, with no radio-toy-jets compromise like in earlier imaginings of jets in squad."
